突然像发现了什么似的。偶然回想起以前看到过的一篇关于Linus Tarvolds的报道。其中一个最鲜明的特点就是安静。

>I want my office to be quiet. The loudest thing in the room – by far – should be the occasional purring of the cat. And when I travel, I want to travel light. A notebook that weighs more than a kilo is simply not a good thing (yeah, I’m using the smaller 11″ macbook air, and I think weight could still be improved on, but at least it’s very close to the magical 1kg limit).
